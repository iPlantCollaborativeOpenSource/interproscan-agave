1. Download and install the latest version of Interproscan and its dependencies
2. Configure the local install based on previous config (manual process)
3. Ensure that user *iplant* has read access to the entire interproscan install
4. Create a new interproscan deployment bundle. Change the appID, version, paraemeters, etc as needed
5. Publish a private version of the app. Test it.
6. Share it with someone from Cyverse and have them test it
